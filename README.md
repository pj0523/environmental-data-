This project is for for crawling air pollution data (2013-2019) from the webï¼ˆhttps://www.aqistudy.cn/historydata/) using selenium and scrapy, including setting up defect logging in scrapy for checking unvisited url links.  P.S. I do not think the air pollution data in this website is highly reliable, because it does not clarify how to average the 24hours data for one day result. I  have some other reliable datasets about air pollution. Welcome to contact me to get it without any commercial purpose. Hope we can do our own contribution to the environment.
